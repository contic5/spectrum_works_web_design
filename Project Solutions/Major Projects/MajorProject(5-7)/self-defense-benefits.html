<h2>Self Defense Benefits</h2>
<h3>Avoiding Confrontation[1]</h3>
<p>No matter how much martial arts you learn, it is safer to avoid having to defend yourself. Fighting always has a risk of injury, even when fighting one on one. Being attacked by multiple people, especially if they are armed is particularly dangerous. It is much safer to avoid a fight.</p>
<p>Presenting confidence through strong posture and clean dress can help make attackers wary.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep track of your surroundings and take a taxi if you are in a dangerous area.</p>
<p>When moving, make sure to avoid looking people dead in the eye. Avoid moving to confront others if someone bumps into you or says something rude. This might be difficult, but it will keep you safer.</p>
<p>Be polite when someone threatens you, because it may help with de-escalating.</p>

<h3>Self Defense as a last resort</h3>
<p>Even if you are cautious, there may be situations where you will still have to fight. Avoid fighting whenever possible, but Taekwondo can help keep you safe.</p>
<p>Taekwondo focuses on using your legs for self defense because your legs have better reach and are stronger than your arms. This requires training your legs to be fast.[2]</p>
    
<p>When defending yourself, it is important to use basic and practical techniques rather than stylish, but inpractical techniques [3]. These techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Straight punches are effective since they are faster than haymakers.</li>
<li>Push kick not only hurts, but it also moves an attacker away. If you are using your feet, having distance is useful.</li>
<li>Round house kick is versatile; you can aim at the ribs, arms or legs.</li>
<li>Side kick is similar to push kick, but it is stronger and more offensive</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with the basics, takedowns and grappling are important skills for self defense.</p>

<h3><i>Only</i> Use Martial Arts for <i>Self Defense</i></h3>
<p>When you defend yourself, you may have to hurt others. This is different from attacking other people for no reason. You are not a martial artist if you use your skills to hurt others unprovoked. You are just a bully. Using your strength to harm others stands against everything Taekwondo and martial arts is about. You will get in trouble for hurting others and depending on your age, you may be charged with assault. To avoid issues, only use Taekwondo to defend yourself.</p>
<p>Every martial arts form starts with a block, since it is assumed you are defending yourself [2]. Using martial arts for anything other than self defense is against the principles of martial arts.</p>
