<h3>Where to find benefits</h3>
<p>If these benefits sound good to you, I would recommend finding a local Taekwondo school in your area. There were about 15,896 martial arts schools in the United States in 2016 [2]. There are 924 martial arts schools in New Jersey alone [3]. Attend class at one of these schools and see how you find it. Typically the first few classes are free so that you can determine if you like doing martial arts and want to stay at that school.</p>
