<h2>Personal Story</h2>
<p>I started training at Taekwondo when I was seven years old. I initially was not very good at it. I had the support of
    a lot of great teachers, who not only pushed me to become better, but also believed in me. I made sure to follow  their advice and stay focused when training.</p>
<p>Over time, I became more skilled at Taekwondo. Intially, sparring was quite difficult for me. I had to learn how to become coordinated. Currently, it is one of my favorite parts of Taekwondo. While I am not natural at teaching, I grew to be a better teacher thanks to my time on my Taekwondo schools Leadership Team. I made a lot of mistakes when teaching, but I got better at it as time went on. I personally think my teaching experience from Taekwondo is why I am here at Spectrum Works. Because I worked at something difficult, I grew as a person.</p>
<p>Taekwondo has not only helped me become more physically fit, it has helped me develop as a person. I am better at self-control and self discipline thanks to my Taekwondo training. I have better mental and physical endurance than when I was younger thanks to Taekwondo. The people who taught me Taekwondo have changed my life for the better.</p>
<p>Martial arts has helped shape who I am today. I would reccomend trying out martial arts. While tough, martial arts helps you develop physically and mentally. It could potentially change your life.</p>
