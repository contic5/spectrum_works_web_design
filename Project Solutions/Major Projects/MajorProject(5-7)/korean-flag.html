<h2>Korean Flag Meaning</h2>
<img style="width:800px; height:auto;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Flag_of_South_Korea.svg/1200px-Flag_of_South_Korea.svg.png">

<p>The Korean flag has a deep meaning behind each part of it [1]. The principles the Korean flag represents are so important to Taekwondo that it is used as the flag for Taekwondo.</p>
<p> The white background represents peace and purity. Each of the four bars on the Korean flag has a specific meaning.</p>

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><h3>Heaven (upper left corner)</h3></td>
<td><h3>Water (upper right corner)</h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h3>Fire (bottom left corner)</h3></td>
<td><h3>Earth (bottom right corner)</h3></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The bars symbolize critical virtues including "humanity, fairness, intellect, courteousness, fruition and vitality."</p>

<p>The red and blue circle at the center of the flag represents Yin and Yang, the concept that that all things have inseparable and contradictory opposites [2]. Examples of Yin and Yang Pairs include, 
<table class="yin-yang">
<tr>
<th colspan='2'>Yin and Yang Pairs</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calmness</td>
<td>Passion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Defense</td>
<td>Offense</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Passive</td>
<td>Active</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Structure</td>
<td>Creativity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Water</td>
<td>Fire</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Darkness</td>
<td>Light</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Earth</td>
<td>Heaven</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Neither Yin nor Yang is superior and a balance between both Yin and Yang is critical. An increase in Yang leads to a decrease in Yin, and vice versa. When there is too much of either, problems occurs. Conversation is a relatable example of yin and yang (I also am trying to work on getting better at conversations). If you are overly passive in a conversation, you won't be able to get your point across and people may have a hard time connecting with you. If you are overly active in a conversation, people may feel overwhelmed and annoyed that they can't get a word in. When there is a balance, harmony is achieved. If you balance talking and listening, people will enjoy talking with you since they will be able to talk and listen to interesting things you have to say as well. Humor is another great example.  
Being silly at the right time can make people laugh. On the other hand, being silly at a time when people need to be serious, such as at a meeting, is disruptive. When work needs to be done, being serious and single-minded is essential and helps with finishing that work. At the same time, being serious all the time can make you seem monotonous and boring, and people would not find you fun to be around. Balance between Yin and Yang is an important part of life.</p>
<p>The Korean Flag is designed so that each part has a meaning. The balance the Koren Flag represents is an important part of Taekwondo.</p>
