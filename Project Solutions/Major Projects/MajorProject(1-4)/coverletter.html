<p>&emsp;I am interested in working as a front end web developer because I enjoy programming. In particular, I would like to work at a small business due my previous work at a marital arts school. Handling modern tasks such as web development is quite hard for businesses without many employees and that is where I would like to provide support. I take my work seriously and I want to see a company that I work for excel.</p>
    
<p>&emsp;I developed essential work skills while studying at Montclair State University. Critical thinking has always been one of my strengths and I further enhanced it at Montclair State University. My Master’s GPA was 3.7 due to how I dedicated myself to my work. Because of my success and focus at Montclair State, I was hired as a graduate assistant when I started my master’s degree. For that position I needed to review student work and hold office hours for about 50 students. I made sure to clearly explain concepts to students and when working with students on assignments I helped them break down the assignments into parts. My work lessened professor workload since I could aid students before they met with a professor. Writing my 40 page thesis also helped me become a detail-oriented worker and a better researcher.</p>
    
<p>&emsp;Upon graduating, I took initiative and learned modern web development skills, such as React and Angular. I am currently employed at Spectrum Works, where I work as a job coach and teach young adults with Autism HTML and CSS. I break down web development concepts into lessons and projects and when teaching I provide code review and feedback based on the needs of each trainee. I adapt lessons plans based on the needs of each trainee and their work schedule.</p>
    
<p>&emsp;One of the main things I have to offer is my dedication. If I do not have a specific skill, I will make sure to look into it. I am willing to put in work to become a skilled worker. I would be interested in interviewing for a position where I can apply my web development skills. Attached please find my resume and feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. Thank you for taking the time to review my information.</p>
