<h3>Task quality optimization in collaborative robotics-IEEE Big Data</h3>
<p>
This paper addresses commonsense knowledge (CSK) to enhance human-robot collaboration (HRC) in large scale smart manufacturing. As big data in collaborative robotics grows, CSK in useful to achieve task optimization as depicted in our simulation studies and laboratory experiments, extendable to real-world applications.

<h3>Robot action planning by commonsense knowledge in human-robot collaborative simulation tasks-IEMTRONICS</h3>
<h4>Received Best Paper Award</h4>
<p>
Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) span the broad realm of mechatronics in general. Humans and robots can collaborate with each other to enhance various tasks, e.g. in the vehicle industry. Facets of AI such as commonsense knowledge can play a significant role here. In this paper, we propose an approach for human-robot collaboration that leverages the fundamental aspects of commonsense knowledge, in order to develop models for the simulation of robotic tasks in real-world applications. This is particularly in the context of robot action planning for object assembly. We consider modeling based on relevant attributes, e.g. the size and weight of parts. The proposed approach thus entails human-robot interaction, mathematical modeling, semantics and pragmatics in commonsense knowledge, as well as challenges specific to the application domain. We describe our approach, focusing on the mathematical modeling, and conduct our experimental evaluation using simulation tasks. As per our claim, this collaborative approach yields better outcomes than humans or robots working alone, which is in line with other such claims in the field of human-robot collaboration. This work sets the stage for conducting laboratory experiments with real robots based on the results of our simulation tasks.

<h3>Task Quality Optimization in Human-Robot Collaboration-AAAI</h3>
<p>
Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) is defined as having a basic understanding of real-world objects, their proper-ties and how they interact and relate with each other. This can often be simple and subtle. Human-robot col-laboration (HRC) is where robots work alongside hu-mans on tasks, often in the same workspace. This paper proposes an approach to use CSK to improve HRC. It is applied in object assembly involving a human and a robot, to optimize task quality. CSK priorities are tested with simulation tasks in object assembly to determine their effectiveness.

<h3>A Panorama of Common Sense: For Autonomous Vehicles and Human-Robot Collaboration-CACM</h3>
<p>
Common sense! We humans often take it for granted so much that we hardly dwell on its imperativeness. Yet an AI system without basic world knowledge is analogous to a human without common sense. This would mean not knowing that sponge is lighter than wood (useful for carrying parts in manufacturing). It would mean being oblivious to the fact that a truck can move while a bridge is stationary (helpful while driving). We humans cannot imagine lacking such common sense! However, the easiest for humans can often be the hardest for AI systems. The systems need to be explicitly programmed with commonsense knowledge to function analogous to their human counterparts. The realm of commonsense knowledge in conjunction with related ones such as autonomous vehicles, and human-robot collaboration present growing areas of research. Due to the advent of autonomous vehicles, there is a greater need for commonsense knowledge to be embodied within their development and simulate subtle, intuitive aspects of human judgment. Robotics has often encountered collaborative tasks between humans and robots to enhance the activities and produce better results than humans / robots would achieve working by themselves. Accordingly, this survey paper outlines and organizes research occurring in these areas along with perspectives and applications. Much work in this area makes an impact on smart manufacturing. The novelty of this paper, to the best of our knowledge, is that it is the first survey encompassing commonsense knowledge, autonomous vehicles and human robot collaboration, emphasizing their impacts and benefiting smart manufacturing.

<h3>Commonsense Knowledge, Autonomous Vehicles and Human-Robot Collaboration: Perspectives and Applications-Journal of Intelligent Robotics and Applications(JIRA)</h3>
<p>
The realms of commonsense knowledge, autonomous vehicles, and human-robot collaboration present growing areas of research in recent times. Due to the advent of autonomous vehicles, there is a greater need for commonsense knowledge to be embodied within their development in order to simulate subtle, intuitive aspects of human judgment. The field of robotics has often encountered collaborative tasks between humans and robots to enhance the respective activities involved and produce better results than humans or robots would achieve working by themselves. Accordingly, this survey paper outlines and organizes some of the research occurring in these areas along with perspectives and applications. Context related to human-robot collaboration and commonsense knowledge is provided via a survey of the literature. Vehicle automation is in focus with the relevant studies: its definition and methods of improvement are highlighted in the paper. Much work in this area makes an impact on smart manufacturing. There is discussion on how human-robot collaboration is beneficial, especially in smart manufacturing contexts, and how commonsense knowledge is useful for the collaboration to occur in an enhanced manner. The novelty of this paper, to the best of our knowledge, is that it is perhaps the first survey encompassing commonsense knowledge, autonomous vehicles and human robot collaboration, emphasizing their impacts on each other and benefiting smart manufacturing. This paper would be potentially interesting to various AI scientists, robot developers, autonomous vehicle manufacturers and researchers in commonsense knowledge.
