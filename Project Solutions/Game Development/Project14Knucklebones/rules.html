<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Both players take turn rolling dice. Each player has a 3x3 grid. When a player rolls a dice, they place it in their own 3x3 grid. Dice can only be placed in empty squares.</p>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>A player's score is the sum of all of their dice. When a value occurs twice in a column, it is multiplied by 2. When a value occurs three times in a columns, it is multiplied by 3.</p>
<h3>Deleting Dice</h3>
<p>When a player places a dice, the other player must remove all of their dice in the same column that match the current dice value.</p>
<h3>Ending the Game</h3>
<p>The game ends when one player completely fills up their board.</p>

<ul>
<li>Get doubles or triples whenever you can.</li>
<li>Destroy opponent's dice whenever you can. Getting rid of doubles or triples is extremely important.</li>
<li>Place high dice in columns your opponent has already filled. They cannot get rid of your dice.</li>
<li>Place your ones and twos in their own column. This column should ideally match up with an opponent's empty column.</li>
<li>Try to place your ninth die first because you will most likely win in that case.</li>
