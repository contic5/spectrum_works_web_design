<h2>Jobs where Teamwork is Crucial</h2>
<p>Many fields heavily emphasize teamwork, meaning that is a skill you should develop if you want to work in those fields [1]. Here are some examples of jobs where teamwork is extremely important and useful.</p>
<h3>Tax Consulting</h3>
<p>Tax consulting involves working with finance teams on how to handle various taxes, how to prepare and examine financial records, and how to work within tax codes [1]. Accounts and auditors work on teams and often need to advise and communicate with clients, so teamwork is a must.</p>
<h3>Human Resources (HR)</h3>
<p>People in Human Resources work with different people within a company to make sure prospective employees are a good fit, including a hiring manager, a benefits administrator and the hiring department [1]. People in HR also work with other departments to determine how to train employees and develop benefits programs.</p>
<h3>Social Media/Web Media</h3>
<p>While it may seem like social and web media are individual focused fields, they are fields that involve working with many groups [1]. With web media, you need to work with developers and writers. For social media, you need to work with photographers, video crews and broadcasters. For both, you would need to work with general departments, such as a legal department, marketing, sales, and public relations. Web development in particularly involves working with a client.</p>
<h3>Arts, Culture and Entertainment</h3>
<p>Many individual fields in arts, culture and entertainment require a large team to succeed [1]. Theater productions have many actors, technicians and writers work together. Restaurants have many chefs in a kitchen that need to cooperate in order to make a meal, along with servers and other people working together to help customers. Event coordinators work with many people, such as caterers and security, to execute events. They also have to work with the client requesting the event to begin with in order for the event to be viewed as a success.</p>
<h3>IT Development/IT Project Management</h3>
<p>IT is a field that requires a lot of teamwork skills [1]. A study by CompTIA showed that “nearly half of IT executives rank teamwork as the top soft skill for employees.” Tech support has to be able to communicate well with clients in order to fix issues. In addition, IT project management and scrum management require working well with others and scrum management in particular is about making sure every employee is able to follow the scum framework.</p>
