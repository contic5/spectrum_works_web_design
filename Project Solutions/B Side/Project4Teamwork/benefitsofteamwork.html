<h2>Benefits of Teamwork</h2>
<p>Teamwork is important regardless of the field that you work in and it carries both practical and emotional benefits [1].</p>
<h3>Developing New Ideas</h3>
<p>Teamwork helps businesses develop new ideas since hearing more perspectives results in more ideas. A diverse team full of members contributing their ideas will help a business succeed [1].</p>
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p>Teamwork is also helpful for solving problems since teams are able to develop and exchange a wide variety of ideas. By collaborating and communicating, a team can determine which idea will resolve the problem they are currently facing [1].</p>
<h3>Supportive</h3>
<p>Teamwork is also supportive since it helps people make sure that everyone is succeeding, not just themselves. Workers are able to support people who are having more trouble and receive support when they need it. Dividing up work also makes it easier to complete. As a team works together to reach one goal, they develop a sense of comradery [1].</p>
<h3>Morale Building</h3>
<p>Lastly, teamwork builds morale for each member of the team. When a worker contributes something useful to a team, they feel that their work is valuable. Working together for a long time helps a team build confidence and trust. This confidence and trust gives each team member a sense of belonging and drive towards reaching a shared goal [1].</p>
