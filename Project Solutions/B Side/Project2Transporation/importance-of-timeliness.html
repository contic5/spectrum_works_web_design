    <p>Getting to work on time demonstrates professionalism to people you work [1]. Obviously, getting to work on time looks good to employers and helps them feel they can depend on you. Being trusted and dependable can also help get promoted. Being on time helps you with more than just looking good, it helps your own work [1].</p>

    <p>Getting to work on time helps you feel better at work. Arriving on time helps with team morale because it shows you are putting in effort [1]. If you are late, you may not get all of your work done during the day and will have more work to do later at home. Relaxing after work helps you recharge for the next day.</p>
    <p>According to professional organize Julie Morgenstern, people who are frequently late have the following reasons for being late [2]. Deadliners are people that are motivated by rushing at the last minute, so they often do not give themselves enough time. Producers like getting work done and often underestimate how long work takes, leading to them potentially being late. Absent-Minded professors end up being distracted frequently and lose track of time or events. There are other reasons that people are late, but these are the most common according to Ms. Morgenstern. If you can determine why you are late, you can figure out ways to help yourself show up on time.</p>
    <p>In order to show up early for places, you can take the following three steps [2]. First, try to write down how long you think tasks will take and once you are done, write down how long they actually took. This will help you determine how long tasks take. Second, you want to plan to be early rather than planning to be on time. If you leave to get somewhere on time, if anything goes wrong on the way there, you will be late. Leave a little early if you have extra time. Lastly, you should try to enjoy getting someplace early. Planning out what to do if you get somewhere early, such as looking at your phone or communicating with someone, can motivate you to leave early.</p>
