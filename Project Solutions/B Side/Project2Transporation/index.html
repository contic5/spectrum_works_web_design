    <h2>Getting to work On Time</h2>
    <p>Commuting for a job is difficult if that job is far away or you need to get to work early in the morning. At the same time, arriving consistently on time or early looks good and can help your career [1]. The following are some ways that you can get to work sooner.</p>
    
    <p>You can get ready for work by preparing for it ahead of time. The night before work, make sure you go to bed early so you can wake up with enough time to get ready [1]. Rather than handling everything during the morning, you can get work done ahead of time. Try to pack lunch and determine what clothes you are going to wear the night before.</p>

    <p>Snowy highways lead to delays in the Tristate area [2].</p>
    
    <p>In general, being on time involves giving yourself extra time [3]. You should give yourself an extra 15 minutes so that way if something goes wrong, you can get to work on time. If a traffic jam occurs, an accident occurs, or the weather causes delays, you will still be able to make it to work on time.</p>
    
    
    <p>If you commute by taking a bus, try to take one that will get you to work early than one that will get you there just on time [1]. A lot can go wrong and if you are only on time, you will then be late. If you go with an earlier bus, you will still be on time even with delays.</p>
    
    <p>Try to avoid using your phone too much in the morning, since time can pass by quickly [3]. Personally, I find this to be troublesome because I get distracted by my phone. Make sure to get ready early and take some time to relax when you get to work early.</p>
    
    <p>As a personal note, make sure not to get overly stressed about being late occasionally. It's better to be 5-10 minutes late than it is to get into an accident. It is more important that you are safe than on time. If something happens that will cause you to be very late and it is truly out of your control, try to call work.</p>
