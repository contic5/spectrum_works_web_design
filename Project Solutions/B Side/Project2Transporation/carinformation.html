    <p>Commuting by car has benefits and downsides.</p>
    <p>Several benefits make commuting by car popular. When you commute by car, you have control over your commute. You can choose how to get to work and take specific works [2]. You are either by yourself or with your work colleagues when you commute by car. If you take a bus or a subway, there are a lot of other people and it may be loud. Within your own vehicle, it is much quieter and you can listen to music.</p>

    <p>Traffic congestion on both directions [3]</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there are some downsides to commuting by car. You can often run into traffic jams, which makes your commute less predictable over long distances [2]. Also, driving can be tiring since you need to concentrate carefully, whereas you do not need to do so when taking public transportation. If bad weather occurs, you need to drive more carefully since driving becomes more difficult when the ground is wet or icy. </p>
    <p>Driving gives you more options and control, but it is quite difficult. You need to determine what you prefer when commuting.</p>
