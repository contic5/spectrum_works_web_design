    <p>Biking is a popular transportation method when you are fairly close to where you work [2]. Cities are trying to bolster bike usage by "investing into bike lanes, public bike rentals and traffic patterns." Biking helps the environment and helps you exercise as well. In some cases, biking can be even faster than driving, such as when you are in a big city [3].</p>

    <p>Mass transit, such as busses, trains, light rails, or subways are very useful [2]. Traffic is less of an issue, especially when using trains, light rails or subways. In addition, you do not need to drive when commuting. Public transportation is quite useful since it is less expensive and allows for more free time [5].</p>
