    <h2>Why Practice Taekwondo?</h2>
    <p>Taekwondo teaches a wide variety of skills [1].</p>

    <li>Physical Techniques, which include punches and kicks. As you learn more Taekwondo, you will learn more advanced techniques. </li>

    <li>Forms, a series of ordered motions that help students learn how to defend themselves.</li>

    <li>Sparring, a more dynamic way of defending yourself. Step sparring is used to teach students how to use a specific number of movements. Free sparring has no limits on the number or order of movements. This dynamic structure helps students learn how to defend themselves.</li>

    <li>Breaking, which is using a hand or leg technique to break through a board of wood. Breaking helps you learn how to execute techniques with power. Some more advanced breakings even involve breaking through bricks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taekwondo is great for physical health and does not use special equipment [2]. Being able to practice without equipment makes training easier and safer. Since you are pacing yourself without equipment, injuries occur less often than if you were using equipment. Taekwondo also helps with muscular strength and flexibility.</p>
    <p>From my personal experience, Taekwondo tends to be a good social outlet as well. If you have a kid, they will have a nice social environment since Taekwondo has a lot of children and they will wind up training with a group of students that are their belt level. You often train with people your own age if you are a teenager.  Taekwondo also has a vibrant community for adults as well.</p>
