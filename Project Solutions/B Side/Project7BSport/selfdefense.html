    <h2>Taekwondo for Self Defense</h2>
    <h3>Caution</h3>
    <p>I do talk somewhat about self defense being risky and dangerous. If you feel that this may bother you, you can view the other two webpages. While some Taekwondo schools are very intense for self defense, others mainly focus on fitness and health, with self defense being more structured. If you do not feel like training in intense situations, you can avoid doing so. That being said, learning how to defend yourself is important and even more casual Taekwondo schools will focus on self defense.</p>

    <p>In general, self-defense is very risky [1]. It is different from practicing martial arts, where you typically spar one person with rules for winning. In a real situation, your attacker is far more likely to try and hurt you. You may be attacked by multiple assailants who may even be armed. No matter what martial art you do, defending yourself is not entirely safe. The most important principles for self-defense are to be aware of your surroundings and to be able to de-escalate situations safely. The best way to win a fight is by not getting into one to begin with.</p>

    <p>While Taekwondo may not be the absolute greatest martial art for self defense, it is still useful [1]. Kicking is useful for self defense since you are able to kick someone while being far away enough from their arms. This will help you be safer. Strong kicks can be very useful when defending yourself [2]. Kicking someone in the leg while defending yourself will potentially knock them down. In addition, Taekwondo helps with general fitness, which will improve your ability to defend yourself.</p>
    
    <p>Training in one martial art is better than not training in any martial arts [2]. Having a well rounded set of skills, including striking, kicking, throwing and grappling, will allow you defend yourself well. Taekwondo does not use a large amount of grappling and punching though, but does use throwing and kicking.</p>

    <h3>Be Careful, Be Aware of your Environment</h3>
    <p>Although practicing martial arts, does help with self defense, it does not make you invincible. Avoid putting yourself at ris by being aware of your environemnt and not putting yourself in dangerous situations. If you are in a situation where you do need to defend yourself, using Taekwondo can be helpful. Fighting is a last resort. Try to de-escalate situations or avoid danger to begin with.</p>
