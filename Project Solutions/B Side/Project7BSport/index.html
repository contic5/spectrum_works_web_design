    <h2>About Taekwondo</h2>
    <p>Taekwondo is a traditional Korean martial art [1]. Taekwondo is composed of three words. The first word is Tae, which means foot. The second word is Kwon, which means fist. The last word is Do, which means way. Taekwondo focuses on using your legs, your fists and most importantly, having discipline and focus behind your actions.</p>

    <p>Taekwondo uses a large number of foot skills, which makes it different from other martial arts [1]. Taekwondo stands out due to its powerful and high kicks [2]. However, Taekwondo also includes various hand techniques to support foot techniques and to help people develop into well rounded martial artists. While Taekwondo does have throwing, it mainly focuses on using punches and kicks [2]. </p>

    <p>One of Taekwondoâ€™s central principles is unity. Taekwondo focuses on a unity between body, mind and life [1]. Practicing Taekwondo requires being calm and focused in order to do well. That calmness and focus can be applied to your life outside Taekwondo as well, which helps you grow. Taekwondo is more than just a series of techniques, it is a way of life. </p>
