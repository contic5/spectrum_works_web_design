    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <p>One in five people have public speaking anxiety, according to researchers at Minnesota State University [1]. Speaking in public is quite difficult, but there are some ways of making it easier [2].</p>
    <p>Just before you start a speech, make sure to calm yourself by closing your eyes and taking deep breaths [2]. You will start calmer because of this. A small pause is not an issue with speaking. Pausing for a few moments will help you avoid using too many filler words such as “uh” or “um.” Admitting you are a little nervous may be helpful as well, since you will not be hiding any tension from your audience. You still need to deliver an effective speech though; your nerves cannot be an excuse. You need to be mentally prepared for a speech.</p>
    <p>When speaking, you should avoid using overly detailed notes, as this makes your speech quite boring [2]. Instead, you should have short one to two word notes for each main point you want to cover. Practicing will also help reduce your anxiety since you will know your speech. Practicing will also help you become less reliant on a full transcript and instead use shorter notes. Also, when practicing, you can record yourself delivering the speech. By doing this, you can see what listening to the speech will be like. Practicing with friends, family and coworkers and asking for feedback can help improve your speech.</p>
