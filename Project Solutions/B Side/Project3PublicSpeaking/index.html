    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>If you have to deliver a speech, you want to plan out your speech rather than writing immediately.  According to speaker.coach, there are seven steps to preparing a speech [1].</p>
    
    <p>First, you want to define the purpose of your speech, which should inform how you write your speech [1]. Some common purposes include “entertaining, informing, persuading, motivating or inspiring.” There always needs to be a main goal when you deliver a speech.</p>

    <p>The Empathy Map, a tool used to determine how your audience feels [1].</p>
    <p>You need to understand your audience when you deliver a speech as well [1]. Learning about your audience allows you to demonstrate you understand them, which helps build rapport. The empathy map is a tool used for user experience and marketing that can also be applied for public speaking. Answering these questions can help you determine how your audience connects with a topic. This can help you determine how to communicate with your audience and how to structure your speech.</p>
        
    <p>What you are saying needs to be significant to your audience [1]. You want your audience to care about what you are saying. To do this, you need to determine what you want to share with your audience and why your audience should care about that. Your speech needs to be clear in order to stand out and in order to do this, you need to focus on one key message. Your key message needs to be short and should only be one to two phrases. The Umbrella Statement model uses core messages to support the umbrella statement, with each core message being supported by evidence.
    </p>
    
    <p>Creating a structure for your speech can also help make it better [1]. It is hard to write without an outline and creating an outline results in organization. According to speaker.coach, these are some common outline directions.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Problem, pathway, solution</li>
    <li>Problem, solution, reasoning</li>
    <li>Situation, complication, solution</li>
    <li>Past, present, future</li>
    </ul>	
    
    <p>Your speech needs to start strong and finish strong [1]. Audiences remember the beginning and the end of a speech the most. Because of that, you need to particularly focus on writing a great beginning and ending. Some strong openings include beginning in an exciting manner, simply explaining why your topic is important, introducing yourself, or talking about the goal of your speech. Strong endings include repeating your key message, connecting back to your opening or providing your audience with a call to action.</p>
        
    <p>Lastly, you need to rehearse your speech [1]. You can first write out your speech fully ahead of time and then practice reading out loud. If you do not have time to do that or after you have finished practicing with the full speech, then you should make bullet points for your speech and practice based on those points. You should record yourself practicing the speech, Afterwards, practice with other people and request their feedback. By following these steps, you should be able to more effectively prepare for a speech.</p>
