    <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
    <h2>What is renewable energy?</h2>
    <p>Renewable energy is energy that comes either natural resources such as the wind or sun or processes that replenish quickly.</p>
    <p>Non-renewable energy comes from resources that takes a long time to replenish. 
    <h2>Importance of renewable energy</h2>
    <p>While both renewable and non-renewable resources are limited, for instance the sun only shines for a certain part of the day, non-renewable resources take much longer to regenerate. Gasoline for cars uses refined crude oil that is from the prehistoric times. The sun shines for on average 12 hours a day, meaning it takes much less time for the sun's renewable energy to regenerate than for oil's non-renewable energy.</p>
    <h2>Types of renewable energy</h2>
    <p>Types of renewable energy include
    <ul>
    <li>Solar Energy</li>
    <li>Wind Energy</li>
    <li>Hydro-electric Power</li>
    <li>Bio-mass Energy</li>
    <li>Geo-thermal Energy</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
    <img src="https://www.sepco-solarlighting.com/hubfs/shutterstock662045977jpg.jpeg"><br>
    <p>Solar energy absorbs the sun's rays to provide power. This is often used in solar pannels.</p>
    
    <h3>Wind Energy</h3>

    <p>Wind energy spins large fans that are connected to an electric generator and create elctricity. Wind power is also the cheapest energy source in many parts of the country.</p>
    
    <h3>Hydro-electric Power</h3>
    <img src="https://d12oja0ew7x0i8.cloudfront.net/images/Article_Images/ImageForArticle_18262(1).jpg"><br>
    <p>Hydroelectric power converts moving water's force into electricity by turning underwater turbines that are connected to an electric generator. </p>
    
    <h3>Bio-mass Energy</h3>

    <p>Burning organic material that comes from plants or animals, crops or wood, generates heat that can be used by a steam turbine to generate electricity. Click on the above image for more info.</p>
    
    <h3>Geo-thermal Energy</h3>
    <img src="https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2019/06/Geothermal-power-plant.jpg"><br>
    <p>Geothermal energy uses heat from deep underground to generate elctricity. Hot underground water is pumped through a turbine to create electricity. </p>
