        <h2 id='fruit'>Benefits of Fruit</h2>
        <p>Fruit is considered to be quite healthy, since it provides a good amount of fiber while also being quite filling and low on calories [1]. Because fruit is quite filling, less fruit needs to be consumed to become satiated, or full compared to other food. While fruit does contain a high amount of sugar, it's difficult to get large amounts of fructose from fruit. On the other hand, it is much easier to consume excessive sugar from sugary drinks. Fruit also contain many other useful vitamins, such as vitamin C, potassium and folate.</p>

        <p>Vegetables are quite beneficial also as they are naturally low in fat and calories in addition to providing key nutrients such as potassium, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin A and vitamin C [5]. Potassium can help with blood pressure. Dietary fiber reduces blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease. Vitamin A helps with eye and skin health while Vitamin C helps with healing injuries and teeth health.</p>

        <h2 id='exercise'>Benefits of Exercise</h2>
        <p>Exercise is something basically everyone can do, regardless of age, abilities, ethnicity, shape or size [9]. While you may think of exercising as intense workouts with cycling or weights, there are other easier forms of working out. Brisk walking is a moderate-intensity aerobic activity that is beneficial for most people. You do not have to intensely workout to benefit from exercise.</p>
        
        <p>Both diet and exercise help with weight loss. To maintain your weight, you want to build up to exercising 150 minutes a week with moderate-intensity exercise [9]. You may need less or more exercise depending on your metabolism. If you want to lose weight without adjusting your diet, you will need a high amount of physical activity.</p>
