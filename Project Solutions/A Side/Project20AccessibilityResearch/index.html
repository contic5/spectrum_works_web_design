    <h2>Accessibility Basics</h2>
    <p>Communicating on the web is easier than communicating in the physical world since there are fewer communication and interaction barriers [1]. Websites need to be well designed so that everyone can use the Web without being stopped by barriers that exclude them. Because of this, accessibility is important for making high quality websites that everyone can use.</p>
    
    <p>Accessibility is where websites are “designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them [1].”</p>

    <p>Web accessibility pays attention to making sure people with disabilities can access the web [1]. Some of disabilities that web accessibility focuses on include</p>
        
    <ul>
    <li>Auditory</li>    
    <li>Cognitive</li>    
    <li>Neurological</li>    
    <li>Physical</li>    
    <li>Speech</li>
    <li>Visual</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, web accessibility also helps people without disabilities access the web in different situations, such as when people temporarily cannot use their senses fully due to injuries or missing glasses [1]. Making accessible websites also helps people who are using different devices that have small screens or have slow internet.</p>
    
    <p>Four principles guide the WCAG’s success criteria; websites need to be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust [2]. Users need to be able to perceive information, meaning that cannot be invisible to all the user’s senses. Users need to be able to operate the interface, meaning that the interface cannot have operations a user cannot perform. Users need to be able to understand the information and operations. The content needs to be robust so that various user agents and technologies can interpret the website’s content. All of these principles need to be fulfilled or else users with disabilities will not be able to use the web.</p>
    
    <p>Each guideline features several success criteria that need to be met so that the guideline is met [2]. Success criteria are either passed or failed, with no in between. Fulfilling success criteria does not necessarily mean that a website is accessible; professionals should review the website and developers should conduct usability tests. Users with disabilities should be part of test groups to determine if the website is actually accessible.</p>
