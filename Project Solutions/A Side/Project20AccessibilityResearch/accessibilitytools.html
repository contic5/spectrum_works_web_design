    <h2>Accessibility Tools</h2>
    <p>Currently, web developers have a number of tools for checking website accessibility. A website needs to be accessible in order to avoid lawsuits if it is a business website. Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd wrote that “a company’s website is subject to Title III if the company otherwise qualifies as a public accommodation [1].” Web accessibility lawsuits have increased considerably from 2018, with there being around 120,000 lawsuits or a 300% increase in 2019 [3].</p>
    <p>WAVE is a collection of tools that web developers use to improve website accessibility for individuals with disabilities [2]. This tool helps detect “accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors.” In addition, WAVE helps web developers learn more about web accessibility and improve at designing accessible websites.</p>
    <p>AccessiBe checks your web domain and sends a report outlining how accessible your website is depending on the result of several tests [3]. You can review the report once it is done. This service is free and primarily focused on WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, which is the main form for legal compliance.</p>
    <p>Web Accessibility by Level Access allows you to enter a webpage url into a form and then checks how accessible that webpage is [4]. This website is free to use, which makes it useful for organizations that want to avoid wasting money and for students who do not desire to spend money.  Level Access’ Elevin Community Edition displays information about how accessible a website is that is updated for free over time. Analysis can be conducted at any time as well, with the system automatically prioritizing the most important pages or components. This tool also alerts web developers to issues and where those issues are located. Elvin Community Edition also guidance and learning resources.
