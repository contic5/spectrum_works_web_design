    <p>From https://www.relavate.org/communicate-well/2018/7/20/21-ways-to-communicate-effectively</p>
    <p>Here are some tips to improve communication to help reduce misunderstandings or conflicts and to increase positive and helpful interactions:</p>
    <h3>1. TAKE TIME TO THINK BEFORE SPEAKING.</h3>
    <p>Saying the wrong thing, even at the right time, can seriously injure a person. Think, for example, of a doctor misspeaking an order for medication that turns out to be wrong and hurts her patient. Saying the wrong thing in a court of law could send an innocent person to jail for a long, long time.  Since words have such power, it is very important how we communicate.  Therefore, take time to listen, be careful how you answer and take time before speaking.</p>
    <h3>2. BE SLOW TO SPEAK AND QUICK TO LISTEN.</h3>
    <p>Take time to focus on what the other person is doing and saying. Most of us hear but do not really listen.  We tend to focus our minds on what we are going to say or how we will answer rather than focusing upon and understanding what the speaker is trying to communicate.  <a href="https://www.donowsley.com/new-blog-1/how-to-improve-your-listening-skills">Check out How to Improve Your Listening Skills.</a></p>

    <h3>3.  SPEAK TO HELP THE LISTENER.</h3>
    <p>Communicate with the intention of helping the listener.  There are many reasons why people talk. Sometimes it's merely to test the relationship, as often happens with small talk.  There are those who think out loud, so as a listener you just happen to be present as they are trying to process their thoughts. Other times it's to present information, for whatever the reason. Still other occasions the speaker is communicating a need for an answer or assistance.</p>
    
    <p>If it's small talk then you can help the listener by presenting something to the conversation that brings value to it and the other person. If you are not sure what the point of the talk is, then simply and politely ask for clarification.  Such a thing can be very helpful with someone who presents something that might be a need.  A good habit to get into in scenarios like that is to ask, "Are you telling me this to bounce ideas off of me or because you are asking me for my help?"

    <p>Regardless of the situation, try to keep in mind how listening to the speaker can bring value to the other person and to the engagement.</p>

    <p>Workplace communication skills can either help your career, or they can stop it dead in its tracks.</p>

    <p>For leaders, effective communication can motivate teams, while poor communication can push good employees out the door.</p>

    <p>For independent contributors, communication skills can earn opportunities that get them closer to their goalsâ€”or they can impede promotions and limit career growth.</p>

    <p>We may know communication is important, but employees at all levels make ongoing mistakes that make their work lives harder.</p>

    <p>Here are 7 ways to communicate more effectively at work:</p>

     <p>Steve Jobs inspired his employees to strive for perfect hardware products. Jack Welch mentored the senior leadership team of GE to new heights. Jeff Bezos is known for articulating the Amazon ethos clearly to employees and the world. All of these leaders possess outstanding leadership skills.</p>
    <p>Here are 14 ways you can improve your communication skills in order to become a more effective leader.</p>
    <h3>1. Learn the basics of nonverbal communication.</h3>
    <p>One study found that nonverbal communication accounted for 55 percent of how an audience perceived a presenter. That means that the majority of what you say is communicated not through words, but through physical cues.</p>
    <p>To communicate clearly and confidently, adopt proper posture. Avoid slouching, folding your arms or making yourself appear smaller than you are. Instead, fill up the space you are given, maintain eye contact and (if appropriate) move around the space.</p>

    <p>Communication in the workplace has dynamically progressed with recent changes in technology, leading to new standards of contacting those you work with. As a result, there are a handful of ways to improve your communication skills that pertain to your professional life.</p>   
    <h3>Quality Content</h3>
    <p>The content of the messages you are trying to get across is the starting point of effective communication. It is imperative to ensure that what you are communicating is clear, and that the information is accurate. Whether you are sending out a mass email to all of your employees or simply having an informal conversation by the water fountain, it is important to know what kind of information you should be communicating in order to be successful in this area. For informal conversations, avoid controversial topics and matters that are too personal, as discussion of emotion-invoking matters or gossip can sometimes lead to loss of professional credibility.</p>
