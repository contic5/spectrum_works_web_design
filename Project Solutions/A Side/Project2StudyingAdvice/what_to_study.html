    <h1>Studying Advice</h1>
    <h2>What to Study</h2>
    <p>Before you start studying for a test, you want to be sure of the material that will be on the test and the structure of the test [2]. You also want to determine the format of the test.</p>
    <p>While reading material can be a useful form of studying, you want to use more active forms of studying [1]. Rewriting material that you read in your own words can help you check how well you remember the material. You can also check to see what you didnâ€™t remember and determine what details you need to review further.</p>
    <p>Flashcards are also a useful way of improving at studying since they are a quick and easy way to study [1]. Just making the flashcards can help you remember information slightly better. Using organized flashcards to study is easier than using full-length notes that are disorganized.</p>
    <p>Lastly, you can benefit from explaining the material you studied from someone else [1]. This will require you to organize the information in a structured manner. You can just talk aloud to your self and teach the material if you cannot find anyone. By actively engaging with the material like this, you will be better prepared.</p>
    <p>Make sure to look back through your past assignments and exams to determine what will be on the exam [2]. Topics that are emphasized in class will likely show up on the exam. Once you determine what types of problems will be on the exam, you want to practice them. For a math test, do problems similar to ones in assignments. For a history exam, practice writing short paragraphs related to the history topics.</p>
    <p>Make sure to divide big topics into smaller topics [2]. If you have multiple topics for a math exam, do practice problems for each topic. If you have multiple chapters for a history exam, try to study one chapter at a time by taking notes and using flash cards.Right before a test, make sure to study a little so that way the material is fresh in your mind.
