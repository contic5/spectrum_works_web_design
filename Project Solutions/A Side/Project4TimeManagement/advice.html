<p>There are seven ways that you can manage time effecitvely [1].</p>
<ol>
<li>SMART Goals- SMART Goals should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.</li>
<li>Prioritize tasks wisely. Make sure to handle important and urgent tasks as soon as possible and determine when to handle non-urgent but important tasks. Handle non-urgent and unimportant tasks later.</li>
<li>Set time limits for tasks- Determining how long you plan on working on a task can help you determine if issues are occurring. In addition, you can determine how long tasks will take ahead of time by doing this.</li>
<li>Take a break between tasks-Taking breaks helps you remain recharged and actually helps you work faster.</li>
<li>Organize yourself- Use a calendar to keep track of more long-term deadlines and tasks that are part of more important projects. Determine what days work well for specific tasks.</li>
<li>Remove un-important tasks/activities- Determine what activities are unimportant and remove them so that you have more time to spend on important tasks.</li>
<li>Plan ahead- Write out ahead of time what you need to do for each day. Writing a to-do list at the same time each day helps you start the next day prepared.</li>
