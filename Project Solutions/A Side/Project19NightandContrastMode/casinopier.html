<h2>Intense Rides</h2>
<h3>Moby Dick</h3>
<p>This family favorite seats riders in a long row. After rocking back and forth, the speed increases and riders are spun to exciting heights. The speed gives the sensation of floating after the boat crests the top and comes back down. Once you think you are done, you are then spun in playthe opposite direction!</p>
<h3>Centrifuge</h3>
<p>Our Indoor Scrambler suspends riders in spinning cars and experience centrifugal force, while spinning along two separate axes. Riders are seated in small carriages clustered together and connected by beams at the top to a central point. Special to our Centrifuge, we play music, have strobe lights, smoke, and multicolored lights during the ride!  We're excited to have this ride back after losing in Superstorm Sandy.</p>
<h3>Disk'O</h3>
<p>Riders are seated on a giant circular disc facing outwards and experience dizzying thrills as the disc spins around while swinging back and forth on a giant half-pipe track. The greatest thrills come at the top of the track, where riders experience a whipping sensation as spectacular views of the beach, pier, and ocean whizz by.</p>
<h3>Hyrdus Roller Coaster</h3>
<p>A Gerstlauer manufactured Euro-Fighter roller coaster with a 72-foot vertical lift and beyond-vertical drop. The sensational first drop of 97° is just the beginning. Tracking at 45 miles per hour, passengers will glide the 1,050-foot coaster track which includes a vertical loop, an Immelman turn and a heartline roll during its course.</p>
<h3>Super Storm</h3>
<p>The riders are seated in a circle extended from a pendulum arm hanging down from the center of the ride. The ride begins to spin around in a circle while swinging back and forth. The greatest thrills happen as the ride continues to spin and goes upside down making a 360 degree revolution! Due to the design of the restraint system, large framed guests may not be permitted to ride. Fight back against the power of the Super Storm and show how Jersey Strong you are!</p>
<h3>Shore Shot</h3>
<p>Shore Shot takes passengers on a double launch thrill like no other, rapidly propelling riders 125 feet up in the air at speeds up to 45 mph and then plunging back down at great speed. The Shore Shot launches 12 passengers through two cycles of positive and negative G-force experiences – back to back!</p>
<h3>Xolo Loca</h3>
<p>Xolo Loca is a brand new, family fun Big Air Coaster uniquely designed for Casino Pier coming to the pier this season! Hop on and choose to roll or spin on the oval shaped open-air cars running on an oval shaped track. The Standard Spinning Cars require the passenger to be 47” to ride alone or 36”-47” to ride with an accompanied adult. The Roll-Over Cars require the passenger to be 55” to ride. And as always, we tuck you in snug as a bug with state-of-the-art lap and safety belts. The Big Air Coaster can hold 16 passengers at a time, 2 passengers in each roll over car and 4 passengers in each spinning car.
We call it Xolo Loca because who does not love dogs! The Xolo is the name of Mexico’s native dog, their pride and joy. Mexico has a rich history and a deep connection to the spirit world, so we invite you to climb aboard your own Spirit Dog and spin away to another place and time!</p>
