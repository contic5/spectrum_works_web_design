    <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
    <p>While I was a colelge student at Montclair State University, one of the events that was offered was a day trip to Hershey Park. I personally had a lot of fun visiting, and because of that, I chose to make a website about Hershey Park.</p>
    <p>The park personally stands out due to having a large collection of roller coasters and thrill rides. Also, some of the thrill rides are moderately intense while others are extremely intense. I enjoy this variety because I cannot handle the most intense rides, but I still enjoy intensity.</p>
    <h2>Main Attractions</h2>
    <h3>Hershey Park</h3>
    <p>Hershey Park is a great place to visit. There are a total of 56 attractions at the park, which vary in intensity from mild to extreme. The theming is somewhat generic, but the quality and quantity of rides more than makes up for it. There are a total of 14 roller coasters to ride. At the same time, there are rides that are fun for younger or less thrill-seeking party members.</p>
    
    <h3>The Boardwalk</h3>
    <p>The Boardwalk is an 11 acre water pakrk that inside of Hershey Park. There are a total of 16 rides within the water park. The rides also vary in intensity and can be quite fun on a hot day.</p>
    <p>The Boardwalk is open from Memorial Day Weekend to Labor Day. If you are really interested in going to the water park, make sure to visit between those dates.</p>
    
    <h3>Chocolate World</h3>
    <p>Chocolate World is outside of Hershey Park itself, but is still fun to visit. It offers a view of how Hershey's Chocolate is made and you are even able to get some candy afterwards. In addition, you can go on a tram tour of the town Hershey, Pensylvania. While the park is more exciting, Chocolate World is both enjoyable and informative.</p>
    <h2>Other attractions</h2>
    <p>Throughout the park, there are other things to do besides go on rides. First, if you get hungry, there are more than 60 places to get food. Keep in mind that most of the places are counter service or quick dining.</p>
    <p>There is also a good amount of entertainment at the park as well, including parades and shows. There are even concerts on some occasions!</p>
    <p>The park has a lot of games if you want to do something fun other than going on rides. They have an video game arcade and a large collection of carnival games. If you think of a carnival game, it is likely there.</p>
